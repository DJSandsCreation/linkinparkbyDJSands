      <h3 id="about">1996–2000: Early years</h3>
      <p> <b>Linkin Park</b>was founded by three high school friends: Mike Shinoda, Rob Bourdon, and Brad Delson. The
        three attended Agoura High School in Agoura Hills, California, a suburb of Los Angeles.After graduating from
        high school, the three began to take their musical interests more seriously, recruiting Joe Hahn, Dave "Phoenix"
        Farrell, and Mark Wakefield to perform in their band, then called Xero. Though limited in resources, the band
        began recording and producing songs within Shinoda's makeshift bedroom studio in 1996, resulting in a four-track
        demo tape, entitled Xero.Tensions and frustration within the band grew however after they failed to land a
        record deal. The lack of success and stalemate in progress prompted Wakefield, at that time the band's vocalist,
        to leave the band in search of other projects.Farrell also left to tour with Tasty Snax, a Christian punk and
        ska band.</p>
      <p>After spending a considerable time searching for Wakefield's replacement, Xero recruited Arizona vocalist
        Chester Bennington, who was recommended by Jeff Blue, the vice president of Zomba Music in March 1999.
        Bennington, formerly of a post-grunge band Grey Daze, became a standout among applicants because of the dynamic
        in his singing style.The band then agreed on changing their name from Xero to Hybrid Theory; the newborn vocal
        chemistry between Shinoda and Bennington helped revive the band, inciting them to work on new material.In 1999
        the band released a self-titled extended play, which they circulated across internet chat-rooms and forums with
        the help of an online 'street team'</p>
      <p>The band still struggled to sign a record deal. They turned to Jeff Blue for additional help after facing
        numerous rejections from several major record labels. After failing to catch Warner Bros. Records on three
        previous reviews, Blue, who was now the vice president of Warner Bros. Records, helped the band sign a deal with
        the company. However, the label advised the band to change their name to avoid confusion with Hybrid.The band
        changed their name to Linkin Park, a play on and homage to Santa Monica's Lincoln Park, now called Christine
        Emerson Reed Park.They initially wanted to use the name "Lincoln Park", however they changed it to "Linkin" to
        acquire the internet domain "linkinpark.com". Farrell returned in 2000, and the band released their breakthrough
        album, Hybrid Theory, that same year.</p>
