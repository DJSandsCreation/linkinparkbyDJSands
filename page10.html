      <h3 id="about">1996–2000: Early years</h3>
      <p> <b>Chester Charles Bennington </b> (March 20, 1976 – July 20, 2017) was an American singer, songwriter,
        musician, and actor. He was best known as the lead vocalist for Linkin Park and was also lead vocalist for the
        bands Dead by Sunrise, Stone Temple Pilots, and Grey Daze. He also appeared in films such as Crank, Crank: High
        Voltage, and Saw 3D.</p>
      <p>Bennington first gained prominence as a vocalist following the release of Linkin Park's debut album Hybrid
        Theory (2000), which was a worldwide commercial success. The album was certified Diamond by the Recording
        Industry Association of America in 2005, making it the best-selling debut album of the decade, as well as one of
        the few albums ever to achieve that many sales.Linkin Park's following studio albums, from Meteora (2003) to One
        More Light (2017), continued the band's success.</p>
      <p>Bennington formed his own band, Dead by Sunrise, as a side project in 2005. The band's debut album, Out of
        Ashes, was released on October 13, 2009. He became the lead singer of Stone Temple Pilots in 2013 to release the
        extended play record High Rise on October 8, 2013, via their own record label, Play Pen, but left in 2015 to
        focus solely on Linkin Park. On July 20, 2017, Bennington was found dead at his home in Palos Verdes Estates,
        California. His death was ruled a suicide by hanging.</p>
      <p>Bennington has been credited by several publications as one of the greatest rock vocalists of his generation.
        Hit Parader magazine placed Bennington number 46 on their list of the "100 Metal Vocalists of All Time". Writing
        for Billboard, Dan Weiss stated that Bennington "turned nu-metal universal".[4]</p>

      <h1>Early Life</h1>
      <p>Bennington was born on March 20, 1976, in Phoenix, Arizona.[5] His mother was a nurse, while his father was a
        police detective who worked on child sexual abuse cases.[6][7] Bennington took an interest in music at a young
        age, citing the bands Depeche Mode and Stone Temple Pilots as his earliest inspirations,[8] and dreamed of
        becoming a member of Stone Temple Pilots, which he later achieved when he became their lead singer</p>
      <p>Bennington was a victim of sexual abuse from an older male friend when he was seven years old.[10] He was
        afraid to ask for help because he did not want people to think he was gay or lying, and the abuse continued
        until he was 13 years old.[11] Years later, he revealed the abuser's identity to his father, but chose not to
        pursue him after he realized the abuser was a victim himself</p>
      <p>Bennington's parents divorced when he was 11 years old. The abuse and his situation at home affected him so
        much that he felt the urge to run away and kill people.[11] To comfort himself, he drew pictures and wrote
        poetry and songs.[11] After the divorce, Bennington's father gained custody of him.[7] Bennington started
        abusing alcohol, marijuana, opium, cocaine, meth, and LSD.[7][8][12] He was physically bullied in high school.
        In an interview, he said that he was "knocked around like a rag doll at school, for being skinny and looking
        different"</p>
      <p>At the age of 17, Bennington moved in with his mother. He was banned from leaving the house for a time when his
        mother discovered his drug activity.[7] He worked at a Burger King before starting his career as a professional
        musician</p>

      <h1>Early Acts</h1>
      <p>Bennington first began singing with a band called Sean Dowdell and His Friends?. They released an eponymous
        three-track cassette in 1993. Later, Dowdell and Bennington moved on to form a new band, Grey Daze, a
        post-grunge band from Phoenix, Arizona. The band recorded three albums: Demo in 1993, Wake/Me in 1994, and ...no
        sun today in 1997. Bennington left Grey Daze in 1998</p>
      <p>Linkin Park - Bennington was frustrated and nearly quit his musical career altogether when Jeff Blue, the vice
        president of artists and repertoire at Zomba Music in Los Angeles, offered him an audition with the future
        members of Linkin Park.[14] Bennington quit his day job at a digital services firm[7] and took his family to
        California, where he had a successful audition with Linkin Park, who were then called Xero.[14] He managed to
        record the song for his audition in a day, missing his own birthday celebration in the process. Bennington and
        Mike Shinoda, the band's other vocalist, made significant progress together, but failed to find a record
        deal.[14] After facing numerous rejections, Blue, now a vice president of artists and repertoire at Warner
        Bros., intervened again to help the band sign with Warner Bros. Records.[</p>
      <p>On October 24, 2000, Linkin Park released their debut album, Hybrid Theory, through Warner Bros. Records.
        Bennington and Shinoda wrote the lyrics to Hybrid Theory based on some early material.[6] Shinoda characterized
        the lyrics as interpretations of universal feelings, emotions, and experiences, and as "everyday emotions you
        talk about and think about."[15][16] Bennington later described the songwriting experience to Rolling Stone
        magazine in early 2002, "It's easy to fall into that thing – 'poor, poor me', that's where songs like 'Crawling'
        come from: I can't take myself. But that song is about taking responsibility for your actions. I don't say 'you'
        at any point. It's about how I'm the reason that I feel this way. There's something inside me that pulls me
        down."[6] Bennington primarily served as Linkin Park's lead vocalist, but occasionally shared the role with
        Shinoda. All Music Guide described Bennington's vocals as "higher-pitched" and "emotional", in contrast to
        Shinoda's hip-hop-style delivery.[8] Both members also worked together to write lyrics for the band's songs</p>
      <p>Hybrid Theory (2000) was certified diamond by the RIAA in 2005.[18] The band's second album, Meteora (2003),
        reached number one on the Billboard 200 album chart,[19] as did its third album, Minutes to Midnight
        (2007).[20][21] Linkin Park has sold more than 70 million albums worldwide.[22] The band has won two Grammy
        Awards, six American Music Awards, four MTV Video Music Awards and three World Music Awards.[23] In 2003, MTV2
        named Linkin Park the sixth-greatest band of the music video era and the third-best of the new millennium.[24]
        Billboard ranked Linkin Park No. 19 on the Best Artists of the Decade chart.[25] In 2012, the band was voted as
        the greatest artist of the 2000s in a Bracket Madness poll on VH1</p>
      <p>Dead by Sunrise - Bennington co-founded Dead by Sunrise, an electronic rock band from Los Angeles, California,
        with Orgy and Julien-K members Amir Derakh and Ryan Shuck in 2005.[27][28] Dead by Sunrise made their live debut
        in May 2008, performing four songs at the 13th anniversary party for Club Tattoo in Tempe, Arizona.</p>
      <p>The band released their debut album Out of Ashes on October 13, 2009.</p>
      <p>Tone Temple Pistols - In February 2013, Stone Temple Pilots parted ways with long-time lead singer Scott
        Weiland. The band recruited Bennington to replace Weiland in May 2013. On May 18, 2013, Bennington took the
        stage at KROQ's Weenie Roast with the band. The setlist included original Stone Temple Pilots songs, as well as
        their first single with Bennington on vocals called "Out of Time", which debuted on May 19 and was available for
        free download via their official website. It was later announced by Bennington and the band in an exclusive KROQ
        interview that he was officially the new frontman of Stone Temple Pilots and discussed the possibility of a new
        album and tour. The song "Out of Time" is featured on their EP High Rise, which was released on October 8, 2013.
      </p>

      <p>Bennington reflected on joining Stone Temple Pilots, stating, "Every band has its own kind of vibe. Stone
        Temple Pilots
        has this sexier, more classic rock feel to it. Linkin Park is a very modern, very tech-heavy type of band. I
        grew up listening to these guys. When this opportunity came up, it was just like a no-brainer." Bennington
        stated in interviews that singing lead vocals in Stone Temple Pilots was his lifelong dream. He left the band on
        good terms due to his commitments with Linkin Park in 2015 and was replaced two years later by X Factor season 3
        runner-up Jeff Gutt.</p>

      <h1>Health</h1>
      <p>Bennington was plagued with poor health during the making of Meteora, and struggled to attend some of the
        album's recording sessions.[48] In the summer of 2003, he began to suffer from extreme abdominal pain and
        gastrointestinal issues while filming the music video for "Numb" in Prague. He was forced to return to the
        United States for surgery, and filmed the remainder of the music video in Los Angeles.Bennington sustained a
        wrist injury in October 2007 while attempting to jump off a platform during a show in Melbourne at the Rod Laver
        Arena. Despite the injury, he continued to perform the entire show with a broken wrist, before heading to the
        emergency room where he received five stitches.</p>
      <p>In 2011, Bennington fell ill again, and Linkin Park was forced to cancel three shows and reschedule two from
        the A Thousand Suns World Tour. Bennington injured his shoulder during the band's tour in Asia and was advised
        by doctors to have immediate surgery, cancelling their final show at Pensacola Beach, Florida, and ending their
        tour.Bennington injured his ankle in January 2015 during a basketball game. He attempted to cope with the injury
        and perform with the aid of crutches and a knee scooter. Linkin Park later canceled the remainder of their tour
        to allow Bennington to undergo surgery and recover.</p>

      <h1>Death</h1>
      <p>On July 20, 2017, Bennington was found dead at his home in Palos Verdes Estates, California; his housekeeper
        discovered him at around 9:00 a.m. PDT.[59][60] His death was ruled a suicide by hanging. Mike Shinoda confirmed
        his death on Twitter, writing, "Shocked and heartbroken, but it's true. An official statement will come out as
        soon as we have one".[61] On July 21, Brian Elias, the chief of operations for the office of the medical
        examiner-coroner, confirmed that a half-empty bottle of alcohol was found at the scene, but no other drugs were
        present.[62] The band announced that they had canceled the North American leg of their One More Light Tour
        following Bennington's death and that tickets would be refunded.[63] Linkin Park has been on hiatus since 2017

      <p>Bennington's funeral was held at South Coast Botanic Garden in Palos Verdes, California, on July 29. In
        addition to his family members and close friends, many musicians who toured or played with Linkin Park were also
        in attendance. The service also included a full stage for musical tribute</p>

        alcohol in the singer's system at the time of death.</p>
