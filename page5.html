      <h3 id="about">2008–2011: A Thousand Suns</h3>
      <p>In May 2009, Linkin Park announced they were working on a fourth studio album, which was planned to be released
        in 2010. Shinoda told IGN that the new album would be 'genre-busting,' while building off of elements in Minutes
        to Midnight.[63] He also mentioned that the album would be more experimental and "hopefully more
        cutting-edge".[64] Bennington also addressed the media to confirm that Rick Rubin would return to produce the
        new album. The band later revealed the album would be called A Thousand Suns.[65] While working on the new
        album, Linkin Park worked with successful film composer Hans Zimmer to produce the score for Transformers:
        Revenge of the Fallen.[66] The band released a single for the movie, titled "New Divide". Joe Hahn created a
        music video for the song, which featured clips from the film.[67] On June 22, Linkin Park played a short set in
        Westwood Village after the premier of the movie.[68] After completing work for Transformers: Revenge of the
        Fallen, the band returned to the studio to finalize their album</p>
      <p>On April 26, the band released an app for the iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad, a game called 8-Bit Rebellion! It
        featured the band as playable characters, and a new song called "Blackbirds" which was unlockable by beating the
        game. The song was also later released as an iTunes bonus track on A Thousand Suns</p>
      <p>A Thousand Suns was released on September 14. The album's first single, "The Catalyst", was released on August
        2. The band promoted their new album by launching a concert tour, which started in Los Angeles on September
        7.[71][72][73] Linkin Park also relied on MySpace to promote their album, releasing two additional songs,
        "Waiting for the End" and "Blackout" on September 8.[74][75][76][77] Furthermore, a documentary about the
        album's production, titled Meeting of A Thousand Suns, was available for streaming on the band's MySpace page.
        On August 31, 2010, it was announced that the band would perform the single live for the first time at the 2010
        MTV Video Music Awards on September 12, 2010.[78] The venue of the debut live performance of the single was
        Griffith Observatory, an iconic location used in Hollywood movies.[79][80][81] "Waiting for the End" was
        released as the second single of A Thousand Suns.</p>
      <p>Linkin Park reached No.8 in Billboard Social 50, a chart of the most active artists on the world's leading
        social networking sites.[84] In other Billboard Year-End charts, the band reached No.92 in the "Top Artists"
        chart,[85] as well as A Thousand Suns reaching No.53 in the Year-End chart of the Billboard Top 200 albums[86]
        and No.7 in the 2010 Year-End Rock Albums, and "The Catalyst" reaching No.40 in the Year-End Rock Songs chart.
      </p>
      <p>The band was nominated for six Billboard Awards in 2011 for Top Duo or Group, Best Rock Album for A Thousand
        Suns, Top Rock Artist, Top Alternative Artist, Top Alternative Song for "Waiting for the End" and Top
        Alternative Album for A Thousand Suns, but did not win any award.[88] The band charted in numerous Billboard
        Year-End charts in 2011. The band was No.39 in the Top Artists Chart,[89] No.84 in the Billboard 200 Artists
        chart,[90] No.11 in the Social 50 Chart,[91] No.6 in the Top Rock Artists Chart,[92] No.9 in the Rock Songs
        Artists Chart,[93] No.16 in the Rock Albums Chart,[94] No.4 in the Hard Rock Albums Chart,[95] and No.7 in the
        Alternative Songs Chart.</p>
