      <p>In an interview with Fuse, Shinoda confirmed that Linkin Park had begun recording their sixth studio album in
        May 2013.[111] The band released the first single from their upcoming album, titled, "Guilty All the Same" on
        March 6, 2014 through Shazam.[112] The single was later released on the following day by Warner Bros. Records
        and debut at No. 28 on the US Billboard Rock Airplay charts before peaking at No. 1 on the Mainstream Rock
        charts in the following weeks.[113][114] Shortly after the single's release, the band revealed their sixth album
        would be titled The Hunting Party. The album was produced by Shinoda and Delson, who wanted to explore musical
        elements from Hybrid Theory and the band's earlier material.[115] Shinoda commented the album is a "90s style of
        rock record". He elaborated, "It's a rock record. It's loud and it's rock, but not in the sense of what you've
        heard before, which is more like '90s hardcore-punk-thrash.'[116] The album includes musical contributions from
        rapper Rakim, Page Hamilton of Helmet, Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine, and Daron Malakian of System of
        a Down.[117][118] The Hunting Party was released on June 13, 2014, in most countries, and later released in the
        United States on June 17.</p>
      <p>Linkin Park performed at Download Festival on June 14, 2014, where they played their debut album, Hybrid
        Theory, in its entirety.[120][121][122] Linkin Park headlined Rock am Ring and Rock im Park in 2014, along with
        Metallica, Kings of Leon, and Iron Maiden.[123][124] They also headlined with Iron Maiden again at the
        Greenfield Festival in July.[125] On June 22, Linkin Park made an unscheduled headline appearance at the Vans
        Warped Tour, where they played with members of Issues, The Devil Wears Prada, A Day To Remember, Yellowcard,
        Breathe Carolina, Finch, and Machine Gun Kelly.[126] In January 2015, the band embarked on a tour to promote the
        release of The Hunting Party, consisting of 17 concerts across the United States and Canada. The tour was
        canceled after only three concerts when Bennington injured his ankle.[127][128] On May 9, Linkin Park performed
        at the first edition of Rock in Rio USA, in direct support for Metallica</p>
      <p>On November 9, 2014, MTV Europe named Linkin Park the "Best Rock" act of 2014 at their annual music awards
        ceremony.[130] The band won the 'Best Rock Band' and 'Best Live Act' titles of 2014 on Loudwire's Music
        Awards.[131] Revolver ranked The Hunting Party as the fourth best album of 2014.[132] In an interview with
        AltWire on May 4, Shinoda reflected on The Hunting Party and commented on Linkin Park's future, stating; "I'm
        really happy with the reaction from The Hunting Party, and I think we're ready to move somewhere new on the next
        album, which will be coming [in 2016]"</p>
