      <h3 id="about">2015–2017: One More Light and Bennington's death</h3>
      <p> <b>Linkin Park</b> began working on new material for a seventh studio album in November 2015.[138] Chester
        Bennington commented on the album's direction by stating, "We've got a lot of great material that I hope
        challenges our fanbase as well as inspires them as much as it has us."[139] In February 2017, Linkin Park
        released promotional videos on their social network accounts, which featured Shinoda and Bennington preparing
        new material for the album.[140] Mike Shinoda stated the band was following a new process when producing the
        album. Brad Delson elaborated: "We've made so many records and we clearly know how to make a record and we
        definitely didn't take the easy way out this time.</p>
      <p>The first single from the new album was revealed to be titled "Heavy" and features pop singer Kiiara, the first
        time the band has featured a female vocalist on an original song for a studio album. The lyrics for the song
        were co-written by Linkin Park with Julia Michaels and Justin Tranter.[142] The single was released for download
        on February 16.[143][144][145] As they have done in the past, Linkin Park had cryptic messages online in
        relation to the new album. The album cover was revealed through digital puzzles across social media; the cover
        features six kids playing in the ocean.[146] The band's seventh album, One More Light, was released on May 19,
        2017.</p>
      <p>Bennington died on July 20, 2017; his death was ruled a suicide by hanging.[148] Shinoda confirmed Bennington's
        death on Twitter, writing, "Shocked and heartbroken, but it's true. An official statement will come out as soon
        as we have one".[149] The band had released a music video for their single "Talking to Myself" earlier that
        day.[150] One day after Bennington's death, the band canceled the North American leg of their One More Light
        World Tour.[151] On the morning of July 24, Linkin Park released an official statement on their website as a
        tribute to Bennington.[152] On July 28, Shinoda announced that donations made to the band's Music for Relief
        charity would be redirected to the One More Light Fund, which had been set up in Bennington's memory.[153] On
        August 4, when the band was initially scheduled to play on Good Morning America, Chris Cornell's twelve-year-old
        daughter Toni (who was also Bennington's goddaughter) appeared with OneRepublic to perform "Hallelujah" as a
        tribute to Bennington and her father.[154] Bennington had previously performed the song at the funeral for
        Cornell, who had also died from a suicide by hanging two months earlier</p>
      <p>On August 22, Linkin Park announced plans to host a tribute concert in Los Angeles to honor Bennington. The
        band thanked fans for their support, stating, "The five of us are so grateful for all of your support as we heal
        and build the future of Linkin Park".[155] The band later confirmed that the concert, titled Linkin Park and
        Friends: Celebrate Life in Honor of Chester Bennington, would take place on October 27 at the Hollywood Bowl.
        The event included Linkin Park's first performance following Bennington's death.[156][157] The event featured
        multiple guests performing Linkin Park songs along with the band.[158] The event was over three hours long and
        was streamed live via YouTube</p>
      <p>In November 2017, the band announced that a live album compiled from their final tour with Bennington, titled
        One More Light Live, would be released on December 15.[160] On November 19, Linkin Park received an American
        Music Award for Favorite Alternative Artist and dedicated the award to Bennington.</p>
