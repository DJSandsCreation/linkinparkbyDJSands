      <h3 id="about">2002–2004: Meteora</h3>
      <p>Following the success of Hybrid Theory and Reanimation, Linkin Park spent a significant amount of time touring
        around the United States. The band members began to work on new material amidst their saturated schedule,
        spending a sliver of their free time in their tour bus' studio.[32] The band officially announced the production
        of a new studio album in December 2002, revealing their new work was inspired by the rocky region of Meteora in
        Greece, where numerous monasteries have been built on top of the rocks.[33] Meteora features a mixture of the
        band's nu metal and rap metal style with newer innovative effects, including the induction of a shakuhachi (a
        Japanese flute made of bamboo) and other instruments.[10] Linkin Park's second album debuted on March 25, 2003
        and instantly earned worldwide recognition,[10] going to No. 1 in the US and UK, and No. 2 in Australia</p>
      <p>Meteora sold more than 800,000 copies during its first week, and it ranked as the best selling album on the
        Billboard charts at the time.[34] The album's singles, including "Somewhere I Belong", "Breaking the Habit",
        "Faint", and "Numb", received significant radio attention.[35] By October 2003, Meteora sold nearly three
        million copies.[36] The album's success allowed Linkin Park to form another Projekt Revolution, which featured
        other bands and artists including Mudvayne, Blindside, and Xzibit.[10] Additionally, Metallica invited Linkin
        Park to play at the Summer Sanitarium Tour 2003, which included well-known acts such as Limp Bizkit, Mudvayne
        and Deftones.[37] The band released an album and DVD, titled Live in Texas, which featured some audio and video
        tracks from the band's performances in Texas during the tour.[10] In early 2004, Linkin Park started a world
        tour titled the Meteora World Tour. Supporting bands on the tour included Hoobastank, P.O.D., Story of the Year
        and Pia</p>
      <p>Meteora earned the band multiple awards and honors. The band won the MTV awards for Best Rock Video for
        "Somewhere I Belong" and the Viewer's Choice Award for "Breaking the Habit".[39] Linkin Park also received
        significant recognition during the 2004 Radio Music Awards, winning the Artist of the Year and Song of the Year
        ("Numb") awards.[39] Although Meteora was not nearly as successful as Hybrid Theory, it was the third best
        selling album in the United States during 2003.[1] The band spent the first few months of 2004 touring around
        the world, first with the third Projekt Revolution tour, and later several European concerts.[1] At the same
        time, the band's relationship with Warner Bros. Records was deteriorating rapidly on account of several trust
        and financial issues.[40] After months of feuding, the band finally negotiated a deal in December 2005.</p>
