      <h3 id="about">2006–2008: Minutes to Midnight</h3>
      <p> <b>Linkin Park</b> returned to the recording studios in 2006 to work on new material. To produce the album,
        the band chose producer Rick Rubin. Despite initially stating the album would debut sometime in 2006, the album
        was delayed until 2007.[50] The band had recorded thirty to fifty songs in August 2006, when Shinoda stated the
        album was halfway completed.[51] Bennington later added that the new album would stray away from their previous
        nu metal sound.[52] Warner Bros. Records officially announced that the band's third studio album, titled Minutes
        to Midnight, would be released on May 15, 2007 in the United States.[53] After spending fourteen months working
        on the album, the band members opted to further refine their album by removing five of the original seventeen
        tracks. The album's title, a reference to the Doomsday Clock, foreshadowed the band's new lyrical themes.[54]
        Minutes to Midnight sold over 625,000 copies in its first week, making it one of the most successful debut week
        albums in recent years. The album also took the top spot on the Billboard Charts</p>
      <p>The album's first single, "What I've Done", was released on April 2, and premiered on MTV and Fuse within the
        same week.[56] The single was acclaimed by listeners, becoming the top-ranked song on the Billboard's Modern
        Rock Tracks and Mainstream Rock Tracks charts.[57] The song is also used in soundtrack for the 2007 action film,
        Transformers. Mike Shinoda was also featured on the Styles of Beyond song "Second to None", which was also
        included in the film. Later in the year, the band won the "Favorite Alternative Artist" in the American Music
        Awards.[58] The band also saw success with the rest of the album's singles, "Bleed It Out", "Shadow of the Day",
        "Given Up", and "Leave Out All the Rest", which were released throughout 2007 and early 2008. The band also
        collaborated with Busta Rhymes on his single "We Made It", which was released on April 29.</p>
      <p>Linkin Park embarked on a large world tour titled "Minutes to Midnight World Tour". The band promoted the
        album's release by forming their fourth Projekt Revolution tour in the United States which included many musical
        acts like My Chemical Romance, Taking Back Sunday, HIM, Placebo, and many others. They also played numerous
        shows in Europe, Asia, and Australia which included a performance at Live Earth Japan on July 7, 2007.[60] and
        headlining Download Festival in Donington Park, England and Edgefest in Downsview Park, Toronto, Ontario,
        Canada. The band completed touring on their fourth Projekt Revolution tour before taking up an Arena tour around
        the United Kingdom, visiting Nottingham, Sheffield and Manchester, before finishing on a double night at the O2
        arena in London. Bennington stated that Linkin Park plans to release a follow-up album to Minutes to
        Midnight.[61] However, he stated the band will first embark on a United States tour to gather inspiration for
        the album.[61] Linkin Park embarked on another Projekt Revolution tour in 2008. This was the first time a
        Projekt Revolution tour was held in Europe with three shows in Germany and one in the United Kingdom. A Projekt
        Revolution tour was also held in the United States which featured Chris Cornell, The Bravery, Ashes Divide,
        Street Drum Corps and many others. Linkin Park finished the tour with a final show in Texas. Mike Shinoda
        announced a live CD/DVD titled Road to Revolution: Live at Milton Keynes, which is a live video recording from
        the Projekt Revolution gig at the Milton Keynes Bowl on June 29, 2008, which was officially released on November
        24, 2008</p>
