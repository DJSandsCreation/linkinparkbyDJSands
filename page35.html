      <h3 id="about">2004–2006: Side projects</h3>
      <p>Following Meteora's success, the band worked on many side projects.[42] Bennington appeared on DJ Lethal's
        "State of the Art" and other work with Dead by Sunrise, while Shinoda did work with Depeche Mode.[1] In 2004,
        the band began to work with Jay-Z to produce another remix album, titled Collision Course. The album, which
        featured intermixed lyrics and background tracks from both artists' previous albums, debuted in November 2004.
        Shinoda also formed Fort Minor as a side project. With the aid of Jay-Z, Fort Minor released their debut album,
        The Rising Tied, to critical acclaim</p>
      <p>Linkin Park also participated in numerous charitable events, most notably raised money to benefit victims of
        Hurricane Charley in 2004 and later Hurricane Katrina in 2005.[1] The band donated $75,000 to the Special
        Operations Warrior Foundation in March 2004.[45] They also helped relief efforts for the 2004 Indian Ocean
        tsunami victims by staging several charity concerts and setting up an additional fund called Music for
        Relief.[46] Most notably, however, the band participated at Live 8, a series of charitable benefit concerts set
        up to raise global awareness.[47] Alongside Jay-Z, the band performed on Live 8's stage in Philadelphia,
        Pennsylvania, to a global audience.[47] The band would later be reunited with Jay-Z at the Grammy Award Ceremony
        2006, during which they performed "Numb/Encore", en route to winning a Grammy for Best Rap/Sung
        Collaboration.[48] They were joined on stage by Paul McCartney who added verses from the song "Yesterday". They
        would later go on to play at the 2006 Summer Sonic music festival, which was hosted by Metallica in Japan.</p>
