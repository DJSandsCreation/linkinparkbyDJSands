      <p>In July 2011, Bennington told Rolling Stone that Linkin Park aims to produce a new album every eighteen months,
        and that he would be shocked if a new album did not come out in 2012. He later revealed in another interview in
        September 2011 that the band was still in the beginning phases of the next album, saying "We just kind of began.
        We like to keep the creative juices flowing, so we try to keep that going all the time ... we like the direction
        that we're going in".[97] Later, on March 28, 2012, Shinoda confirmed that the band is filming a music video for
        "Burn It Down".[98][99] Joe Hahn directed the video.[100] Shinoda spoke to Co.Create about the album's art,
        saying that it will "blow them [the fans] away ... the average person is not going to be able to look at it and
        go, I understand that that's completely new, like not just the image but the way they made the image is totally
        new. So there's going to be that"</p>
      <p>On April 15, 2012, Shinoda announced that Living Things would be the title of Linkin Park's fifth album.[102]
        Shinoda stated that they chose the title Living Things because the album is more about people, personal
        interactions, and it is far more personal than their previous albums.[103] The band promoted the album on the
        2012 edition of the Honda Civic Tour, with co-headliners Incubus. The band performed "Burn It Down" at 2012
        Billboard Music Awards. On May 24, the band released the music video for "Burn It Down" and debuted "Lies Greed
        Misery", another song from Living Things, on BBC Radio 1. "Powerless", the twelfth and closing track of the
        album, was featured in the closing credits of the film Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter.[</p>
      <p>Living Things sold over 223,000 copies during its debut week, ranking No. 1 on the US Albums Charts.[105]
        Linkin Park's single, "Castle of Glass", was nominated for 'Best Song in a Game' at the 2012 Spike Video Game
        Awards. The band also performed at the award ceremony on December 7, but lost the award to "Cities" by
        Beck.[106] Linkin Park also played at the Soundwave music festival in Australia, where they shared the stage
        with Metallica, Paramore, Slayer and Sum 41.</p>
      <p>On August 10, 2013, the band collaborated with American musician Steve Aoki to record the song "A Light That
        Never Comes" for Linkin Park's online puzzle-action game LP Recharge (short for Linkin Park Recharge), which was
        launched on Facebook and the official LP Recharge website on September 12, 2013. On the day of the game's
        release, Linkin Park made a post on their Facebook explaining that the song used to promote the game would be
        included on a new remix album, entitled Recharged, which was released on October 29, 2013 on CD, vinyl, and
        digital download. Similar to Reanimation, the album features remixes of ten of the songs from Living Things,
        with contributions from other artists, such as Ryu of Styles of Beyond, Pusha T, Datsik, KillSonik, Bun B, Money
        Mark, and Rick Rubin.[108][109] The band also worked on the soundtrack for the film Mall, which was directed by
        Joe Hahn</p>
