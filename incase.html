      <h3 id="about">About Linkin Park</h3>
      <p> <b>Linkin Park</b> is an American rock band from Agoura Hills, California. The band's current lineup
        comprises
        vocalist/rhythm guitarist Mike Shinoda, lead guitarist Brad Delson, bassist Dave Farrell, DJ/keyboardist Joe
        Hahn and drummer Rob Bourdon, all of whom are founding members. Vocalists Mark Wakefield and Chester
        Bennington
        and bassist Kyle Christner are former members of the band. Categorized as alternative rock, Linkin Park has
        experimented with their music throughout their career by incorporating heavy metal, hard rock, hip hop, pop,
        and
        electronica.</p>
      <p>Formed in 1996, Linkin Park rose to international fame with their debut studio album, Hybrid Theory (2000),
        which became certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[3] Their second album,
        Meteora (2003), continued the band's success, topping the Billboard 200, and was followed by extensive touring
        and charity work.[4] Having adapted nu metal and rap metal to a radio-friendly yet densely layered style in
        their first two albums,[5][6] the band explored other genres on their third album, Minutes to Midnight (2007),
        which also topped the Billboard 200.[7]</p>
      <p>Linkin Park continued to explore a wider variation of musical types in their fourth album, A Thousand Suns
        (2010), layering their music with more electronic sounds. The band's fifth album, Living Things (2012),
        combined
        musical elements from all of their previous records. Their sixth album, The Hunting Party (2014), returned to
        a
        heavier rock sound, and their seventh album, One More Light (2017), is a more electronic and pop-oriented
        record
      </p>
      <p>Linkin Park is among the best-selling bands of the 21st century and the world's best-selling music artists,
        having sold over 70 million albums worldwide. They have won two Grammy Awards, six American Music Awards, four
        MTV Video Music Awards and three World Music Awards. In 2003, MTV2 named Linkin Park the sixth-greatest band
        of
        the music video era and the third-best of the new millennium. Billboard ranked Linkin Park No. 19 on the Best
        Artists of the Decade list. In 2012, the band was voted as the greatest artist of the 2000s in a Bracket
        Madness
        poll on VH1. In 2014, the band was declared as "The Biggest Rock Band in the World Right Now" by Kerrang!.</p>
      <p>Linkin Park has been on an indefinite hiatus since longtime lead vocalist Bennington committed suicide in
        July
        2017, and has not yet made plans to continue with a new vocalist, leaving the band's future uncertain.</p>

      <h3 id="about">2000–2002: Hybrid Theory and Reanimation</h3>
      <p> <b>Linkin Park</b>released Hybrid Theory on October 24, 2000.The album, which represented half a decade's
        worth of the band's work, was edited by Don Gilmore.Hybrid Theory was a massive commercial success; it sold more
        than 4.8 million copies during its debut year, earning it the status of best-selling album of 2001, while
        singles such as "Crawling" and "One Step Closer" established themselves as staples among alternative rock radio
        play lists during the year.Additionally, other singles from the album were featured in films such as Dracula
        2000, Little Nicky, and Valentine.Hybrid Theory won a Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance for the song
        "Crawling" and was nominated for two other Grammy Awards: Best New Artist and Best Rock Album.MTV awarded the
        band their Best Rock Video and Best Direction awards for "In the End".Through the winning of the Grammy for Best
        Hard Rock Performance, Hybrid Theory's overall success had catapulted the band into mainstream success.</p>
      <p>During this time, Linkin Park received many invitations to perform on many high-profile tours and concerts
        including Ozzfest, Family Values Tour, and KROQ Almost Acoustic Christmas.The band worked with Jessica Sklar to
        found their official fan club and street team, "Linkin Park Underground", in November 2001.Linkin Park also
        formed their own tour, Projekt Revolution, which featured other notable artists such as Cypress Hill, Adema, and
        Snoop Dogg.Within a year's stretch, Linkin Park had performed at over 320 concerts. The experiences and
        performances of the precocious band were documented in their first DVD, Frat Party at the Pankake Festival,
        which debuted in November 2001. Now reunited with former bassist Phoenix, the band began work on a remix album,
        dubbed Reanimation, which would include works from Hybrid Theory and non-album tracks.[1] Reanimation debuted on
        July 30, 2002, featuring the likes of Black Thought, Jonathan Davis, Aaron Lewis, and many others.Reanimation
        claimed the second spot on the Billboard 200, and sold nearly 270,000 copies during its debut week.Hybrid Theory
        is also in the RIAA's Top 100 Albums</p>

      <h3 id="about">2002–2004: Meteora</h3>
      <p>Following the success of Hybrid Theory and Reanimation, Linkin Park spent a significant amount of time touring
        around the United States. The band members began to work on new material amidst their saturated schedule,
        spending a sliver of their free time in their tour bus' studio.[32] The band officially announced the production
        of a new studio album in December 2002, revealing their new work was inspired by the rocky region of Meteora in
        Greece, where numerous monasteries have been built on top of the rocks.[33] Meteora features a mixture of the
        band's nu metal and rap metal style with newer innovative effects, including the induction of a shakuhachi (a
        Japanese flute made of bamboo) and other instruments.[10] Linkin Park's second album debuted on March 25, 2003
        and instantly earned worldwide recognition,[10] going to No. 1 in the US and UK, and No. 2 in Australia</p>
      <p>Meteora sold more than 800,000 copies during its first week, and it ranked as the best selling album on the
        Billboard charts at the time.[34] The album's singles, including "Somewhere I Belong", "Breaking the Habit",
        "Faint", and "Numb", received significant radio attention.[35] By October 2003, Meteora sold nearly three
        million copies.[36] The album's success allowed Linkin Park to form another Projekt Revolution, which featured
        other bands and artists including Mudvayne, Blindside, and Xzibit.[10] Additionally, Metallica invited Linkin
        Park to play at the Summer Sanitarium Tour 2003, which included well-known acts such as Limp Bizkit, Mudvayne
        and Deftones.[37] The band released an album and DVD, titled Live in Texas, which featured some audio and video
        tracks from the band's performances in Texas during the tour.[10] In early 2004, Linkin Park started a world
        tour titled the Meteora World Tour. Supporting bands on the tour included Hoobastank, P.O.D., Story of the Year
        and Pia</p>
      <p>Meteora earned the band multiple awards and honors. The band won the MTV awards for Best Rock Video for
        "Somewhere I Belong" and the Viewer's Choice Award for "Breaking the Habit".[39] Linkin Park also received
        significant recognition during the 2004 Radio Music Awards, winning the Artist of the Year and Song of the Year
        ("Numb") awards.[39] Although Meteora was not nearly as successful as Hybrid Theory, it was the third best
        selling album in the United States during 2003.[1] The band spent the first few months of 2004 touring around
        the world, first with the third Projekt Revolution tour, and later several European concerts.[1] At the same
        time, the band's relationship with Warner Bros. Records was deteriorating rapidly on account of several trust
        and financial issues.[40] After months of feuding, the band finally negotiated a deal in December 2005.</p>

      <h3 id="about">2004–2006: Side projects</h3>
      <p>Following Meteora's success, the band worked on many side projects.[42] Bennington appeared on DJ Lethal's
        "State of the Art" and other work with Dead by Sunrise, while Shinoda did work with Depeche Mode.[1] In 2004,
        the band began to work with Jay-Z to produce another remix album, titled Collision Course. The album, which
        featured intermixed lyrics and background tracks from both artists' previous albums, debuted in November 2004.
        Shinoda also formed Fort Minor as a side project. With the aid of Jay-Z, Fort Minor released their debut album,
        The Rising Tied, to critical acclaim</p>
      <p>Linkin Park also participated in numerous charitable events, most notably raised money to benefit victims of
        Hurricane Charley in 2004 and later Hurricane Katrina in 2005.[1] The band donated $75,000 to the Special
        Operations Warrior Foundation in March 2004.[45] They also helped relief efforts for the 2004 Indian Ocean
        tsunami victims by staging several charity concerts and setting up an additional fund called Music for
        Relief.[46] Most notably, however, the band participated at Live 8, a series of charitable benefit concerts set
        up to raise global awareness.[47] Alongside Jay-Z, the band performed on Live 8's stage in Philadelphia,
        Pennsylvania, to a global audience.[47] The band would later be reunited with Jay-Z at the Grammy Award Ceremony
        2006, during which they performed "Numb/Encore", en route to winning a Grammy for Best Rap/Sung
        Collaboration.[48] They were joined on stage by Paul McCartney who added verses from the song "Yesterday". They
        would later go on to play at the 2006 Summer Sonic music festival, which was hosted by Metallica in Japan.</p>

      <h3 id="about">2006–2008: Minutes to Midnight</h3>
      <p> <b>Linkin Park</b> returned to the recording studios in 2006 to work on new material. To produce the album,
        the band chose producer Rick Rubin. Despite initially stating the album would debut sometime in 2006, the album
        was delayed until 2007.[50] The band had recorded thirty to fifty songs in August 2006, when Shinoda stated the
        album was halfway completed.[51] Bennington later added that the new album would stray away from their previous
        nu metal sound.[52] Warner Bros. Records officially announced that the band's third studio album, titled Minutes
        to Midnight, would be released on May 15, 2007 in the United States.[53] After spending fourteen months working
        on the album, the band members opted to further refine their album by removing five of the original seventeen
        tracks. The album's title, a reference to the Doomsday Clock, foreshadowed the band's new lyrical themes.[54]
        Minutes to Midnight sold over 625,000 copies in its first week, making it one of the most successful debut week
        albums in recent years. The album also took the top spot on the Billboard Charts</p>
      <p>The album's first single, "What I've Done", was released on April 2, and premiered on MTV and Fuse within the
        same week.[56] The single was acclaimed by listeners, becoming the top-ranked song on the Billboard's Modern
        Rock Tracks and Mainstream Rock Tracks charts.[57] The song is also used in soundtrack for the 2007 action film,
        Transformers. Mike Shinoda was also featured on the Styles of Beyond song "Second to None", which was also
        included in the film. Later in the year, the band won the "Favorite Alternative Artist" in the American Music
        Awards.[58] The band also saw success with the rest of the album's singles, "Bleed It Out", "Shadow of the Day",
        "Given Up", and "Leave Out All the Rest", which were released throughout 2007 and early 2008. The band also
        collaborated with Busta Rhymes on his single "We Made It", which was released on April 29.</p>
      <p>Linkin Park embarked on a large world tour titled "Minutes to Midnight World Tour". The band promoted the
        album's release by forming their fourth Projekt Revolution tour in the United States which included many musical
        acts like My Chemical Romance, Taking Back Sunday, HIM, Placebo, and many others. They also played numerous
        shows in Europe, Asia, and Australia which included a performance at Live Earth Japan on July 7, 2007.[60] and
        headlining Download Festival in Donington Park, England and Edgefest in Downsview Park, Toronto, Ontario,
        Canada. The band completed touring on their fourth Projekt Revolution tour before taking up an Arena tour around
        the United Kingdom, visiting Nottingham, Sheffield and Manchester, before finishing on a double night at the O2
        arena in London. Bennington stated that Linkin Park plans to release a follow-up album to Minutes to
        Midnight.[61] However, he stated the band will first embark on a United States tour to gather inspiration for
        the album.[61] Linkin Park embarked on another Projekt Revolution tour in 2008. This was the first time a
        Projekt Revolution tour was held in Europe with three shows in Germany and one in the United Kingdom. A Projekt
        Revolution tour was also held in the United States which featured Chris Cornell, The Bravery, Ashes Divide,
        Street Drum Corps and many others. Linkin Park finished the tour with a final show in Texas. Mike Shinoda
        announced a live CD/DVD titled Road to Revolution: Live at Milton Keynes, which is a live video recording from
        the Projekt Revolution gig at the Milton Keynes Bowl on June 29, 2008, which was officially released on November
        24, 2008</p>

      <p>In May 2009, Linkin Park announced they were working on a fourth studio album, which was planned to be released
        in 2010. Shinoda told IGN that the new album would be 'genre-busting,' while building off of elements in Minutes
        to Midnight.[63] He also mentioned that the album would be more experimental and "hopefully more
        cutting-edge".[64] Bennington also addressed the media to confirm that Rick Rubin would return to produce the
        new album. The band later revealed the album would be called A Thousand Suns.[65] While working on the new
        album, Linkin Park worked with successful film composer Hans Zimmer to produce the score for Transformers:
        Revenge of the Fallen.[66] The band released a single for the movie, titled "New Divide". Joe Hahn created a
        music video for the song, which featured clips from the film.[67] On June 22, Linkin Park played a short set in
        Westwood Village after the premier of the movie.[68] After completing work for Transformers: Revenge of the
        Fallen, the band returned to the studio to finalize their album</p>
      <p>On April 26, the band released an app for the iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad, a game called 8-Bit Rebellion! It
        featured the band as playable characters, and a new song called "Blackbirds" which was unlockable by beating the
        game. The song was also later released as an iTunes bonus track on A Thousand Suns</p>
      <p>A Thousand Suns was released on September 14. The album's first single, "The Catalyst", was released on August
        2. The band promoted their new album by launching a concert tour, which started in Los Angeles on September

        "Waiting for the End" and "Blackout" on September 8.[74][75][76][77] Furthermore, a documentary about the
        album's production, titled Meeting of A Thousand Suns, was available for streaming on the band's MySpace page.
        On August 31, 2010, it was announced that the band would perform the single live for the first time at the 2010
        MTV Video Music Awards on September 12, 2010.[78] The venue of the debut live performance of the single was
        Griffith Observatory, an iconic location used in Hollywood movies.[79][80][81] "Waiting for the End" was
        released as the second single of A Thousand Suns.</p>
      <p>Linkin Park reached No.8 in Billboard Social 50, a chart of the most active artists on the world's leading
        social networking sites.[84] In other Billboard Year-End charts, the band reached No.92 in the "Top Artists"
        chart,[85] as well as A Thousand Suns reaching No.53 in the Year-End chart of the Billboard Top 200 albums[86]
        and No.7 in the 2010 Year-End Rock Albums, and "The Catalyst" reaching No.40 in the Year-End Rock Songs chart.

      <h3 id="about">2011–2013: Living Things and Recharged</h3>
      <p>In July 2011, Bennington told Rolling Stone that Linkin Park aims to produce a new album every eighteen months,
        and that he would be shocked if a new album did not come out in 2012. He later revealed in another interview in
        September 2011 that the band was still in the beginning phases of the next album, saying "We just kind of began.
        We like to keep the creative juices flowing, so we try to keep that going all the time ... we like the direction
        that we're going in".[97] Later, on March 28, 2012, Shinoda confirmed that the band is filming a music video for
        "Burn It Down".[98][99] Joe Hahn directed the video.[100] Shinoda spoke to Co.Create about the album's art,
        saying that it will "blow them [the fans] away ... the average person is not going to be able to look at it and
        go, I understand that that's completely new, like not just the image but the way they made the image is totally
        new. So there's going to be that"</p>
      <p>On April 15, 2012, Shinoda announced that Living Things would be the title of Linkin Park's fifth album.[102]
        Shinoda stated that they chose the title Living Things because the album is more about people, personal
        interactions, and it is far more personal than their previous albums.[103] The band promoted the album on the
        2012 edition of the Honda Civic Tour, with co-headliners Incubus. The band performed "Burn It Down" at 2012
        Billboard Music Awards. On May 24, the band released the music video for "Burn It Down" and debuted "Lies Greed
        Misery", another song from Living Things, on BBC Radio 1. "Powerless", the twelfth and closing track of the
        album, was featured in the closing credits of the film Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter.[</p>
      <p>Living Things sold over 223,000 copies during its debut week, ranking No. 1 on the US Albums Charts.[105]
        Linkin Park's single, "Castle of Glass", was nominated for 'Best Song in a Game' at the 2012 Spike Video Game
        Awards. The band also performed at the award ceremony on December 7, but lost the award to "Cities" by
        Beck.[106] Linkin Park also played at the Soundwave music festival in Australia, where they shared the stage
        with Metallica, Paramore, Slayer and Sum 41.</p>
      <p>On August 10, 2013, the band collaborated with American musician Steve Aoki to record the song "A Light That
        Never Comes" for Linkin Park's online puzzle-action game LP Recharge (short for Linkin Park Recharge), which was
        launched on Facebook and the official LP Recharge website on September 12, 2013. On the day of the game's
        release, Linkin Park made a post on their Facebook explaining that the song used to promote the game would be
        included on a new remix album, entitled Recharged, which was released on October 29, 2013 on CD, vinyl, and
        digital download. Similar to Reanimation, the album features remixes of ten of the songs from Living Things,
        with contributions from other artists, such as Ryu of Styles of Beyond, Pusha T, Datsik, KillSonik, Bun B, Money
        Mark, and Rick Rubin.[108][109] The band also worked on the soundtrack for the film Mall, which was directed by
        Joe Hahn</p>

        would be titled The Hunting Party. The album was produced by Shinoda and Delson, who wanted to explore musical
        elements from Hybrid Theory and the band's earlier material.[115] Shinoda commented the album is a "90s style of
        rock record". He elaborated, "It's a rock record. It's loud and it's rock, but not in the sense of what you've
        heard before, which is more like '90s hardcore-punk-thrash.'[116] The album includes musical contributions from
        rapper Rakim, Page Hamilton of Helmet, Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine, and Daron Malakian of System of
        a Down.[117][118] The Hunting Party was released on June 13, 2014, in most countries, and later released in the
        United States on June 17.</p>

        release of The Hunting Party, consisting of 17 concerts across the United States and Canada. The tour was
        canceled after only three concerts when Bennington injured his ankle.[127][128] On May 9, Linkin Park performed
        at the first edition of Rock in Rio USA, in direct support for Metallica</p>

      <h3 id="about">2015–2017: One More Light and Bennington's death</h3>
      <p> <b>Linkin Park</b> began working on new material for a seventh studio album in November 2015.[138] Chester
        Bennington commented on the album's direction by stating, "We've got a lot of great material that I hope
        challenges our fanbase as well as inspires them as much as it has us."[139] In February 2017, Linkin Park
        released promotional videos on their social network accounts, which featured Shinoda and Bennington preparing
        new material for the album.[140] Mike Shinoda stated the band was following a new process when producing the
        album. Brad Delson elaborated: "We've made so many records and we clearly know how to make a record and we
        definitely didn't take the easy way out this time.</p>
      <p>The first single from the new album was revealed to be titled "Heavy" and features pop singer Kiiara, the first
        time the band has featured a female vocalist on an original song for a studio album. The lyrics for the song
        were co-written by Linkin Park with Julia Michaels and Justin Tranter.[142] The single was released for download
        on February 16.[143][144][145] As they have done in the past, Linkin Park had cryptic messages online in
        relation to the new album. The album cover was revealed through digital puzzles across social media; the cover
        features six kids playing in the ocean.[146] The band's seventh album, One More Light, was released on May 19,
        2017.</p>
      <p>Bennington died on July 20, 2017; his death was ruled a suicide by hanging.[148] Shinoda confirmed Bennington's
        death on Twitter, writing, "Shocked and heartbroken, but it's true. An official statement will come out as soon
        as we have one".[149] The band had released a music video for their single "Talking to Myself" earlier that
        day.[150] One day after Bennington's death, the band canceled the North American leg of their One More Light
        World Tour.[151] On the morning of July 24, Linkin Park released an official statement on their website as a
        tribute to Bennington.[152] On July 28, Shinoda announced that donations made to the band's Music for Relief
        charity would be redirected to the One More Light Fund, which had been set up in Bennington's memory.[153] On
        August 4, when the band was initially scheduled to play on Good Morning America, Chris Cornell's twelve-year-old
        daughter Toni (who was also Bennington's goddaughter) appeared with OneRepublic to perform "Hallelujah" as a
        tribute to Bennington and her father.[154] Bennington had previously performed the song at the funeral for
        Cornell, who had also died from a suicide by hanging two months earlier</p>
      <p>On August 22, Linkin Park announced plans to host a tribute concert in Los Angeles to honor Bennington. The
        band thanked fans for their support, stating, "The five of us are so grateful for all of your support as we heal
        and build the future of Linkin Park".[155] The band later confirmed that the concert, titled Linkin Park and
        Friends: Celebrate Life in Honor of Chester Bennington, would take place on October 27 at the Hollywood Bowl.
        The event included Linkin Park's first performance following Bennington's death.[156][157] The event featured
        multiple guests performing Linkin Park songs along with the band.[158] The event was over three hours long and
        was streamed live via YouTube</p>
      <p>In November 2017, the band announced that a live album compiled from their final tour with Bennington, titled
        One More Light Live, would be released on December 15.[160] On November 19, Linkin Park received an American
        Music Award for Favorite Alternative Artist and dedicated the award to Bennington.</p>

      <h3 id="about">2017–present: Hiatus and future plans</h3>
      <p> During an Instagram live chat on December 17, 2017, Shinoda was asked whether Linkin Park would perform with a
        hologram version of Bennington in the future. He replied, "Can we not do a holographic Chester? I can't even
        wrap my head around the idea of a holographic Chester. I've actually heard other people outside the band suggest
        that, and there's absolutely no way. I cannot fuck with that.</p>
      <p>On January 28, 2018, Shinoda replied to a tweet from a fan inquiring about his future with Linkin Park, writing
        "I have every intention on continuing with LP, and the guys feel the same. We have a lot of rebuilding to do,
        and questions to answer, so it'll take time."[163] On March 29, 2018, however, Shinoda stated that he is
        uncertain of Linkin Park's future when being interviewed by Vulture.</p>
      <p>On April 17, 2018, Linkin Park was nominated for three awards at the 2018 Billboard Music Awards, but did not
        win any of them.</p>
      <p>The band was presented with The George and Ira Gershwin Award for Lifetime Musical Achievement at UCLA on May
        18, 2018</p>
      <p>On February 18, 2019, Shinoda said in an interview that the band is open to the idea of continuing though what
        form that takes has yet to be decided. Shinoda stated "I know the other guys, they love to be onstage, they love
        to be in a studio, and so to not do that would be like, I don’t know, almost like unhealthy.” When asked about
        the band's future minus Bennington, Shinoda stated, “It’s not my goal to look for a new singer. If it does
        happen, it has to happen naturally. If we find someone that is a great person and good stylistic fit, I could
        see trying to do some stuff with somebody. I would never want to feel like we are replacing Chester.”[167] As of
        October 2019, the band remains on an "indefinite hiatus".</p>
