      <h3 id="about">About Linkin Park</h3>
      <p> <b>Linkin Park</b> is an American rock band from Agoura Hills, California. The band's current lineup
        comprises
        vocalist/rhythm guitarist Mike Shinoda, lead guitarist Brad Delson, bassist Dave Farrell, DJ/keyboardist Joe
        Hahn and drummer Rob Bourdon, all of whom are founding members. Vocalists Mark Wakefield and Chester
        Bennington
        and bassist Kyle Christner are former members of the band. Categorized as alternative rock, Linkin Park has
        experimented with their music throughout their career by incorporating heavy metal, hard rock, hip hop, pop,
        and
        electronica.</p>
      <p>Formed in 1996, Linkin Park rose to international fame with their debut studio album, Hybrid Theory (2000),
        which became certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[3] Their second album,
        Meteora (2003), continued the band's success, topping the Billboard 200, and was followed by extensive touring
        and charity work.[4] Having adapted nu metal and rap metal to a radio-friendly yet densely layered style in
        their first two albums,[5][6] the band explored other genres on their third album, Minutes to Midnight (2007),
        which also topped the Billboard 200.[7]</p>
      <p>Linkin Park continued to explore a wider variation of musical types in their fourth album, A Thousand Suns
        (2010), layering their music with more electronic sounds. The band's fifth album, Living Things (2012),
        combined
        musical elements from all of their previous records. Their sixth album, The Hunting Party (2014), returned to
        a
        heavier rock sound, and their seventh album, One More Light (2017), is a more electronic and pop-oriented
        record
      </p>
      <p>Linkin Park is among the best-selling bands of the 21st century and the world's best-selling music artists,
        having sold over 70 million albums worldwide. They have won two Grammy Awards, six American Music Awards, four
        MTV Video Music Awards and three World Music Awards. In 2003, MTV2 named Linkin Park the sixth-greatest band
        of
        the music video era and the third-best of the new millennium. Billboard ranked Linkin Park No. 19 on the Best
        Artists of the Decade list. In 2012, the band was voted as the greatest artist of the 2000s in a Bracket
        Madness
        poll on VH1. In 2014, the band was declared as "The Biggest Rock Band in the World Right Now" by Kerrang!.</p>
      <p>Linkin Park has been on an indefinite hiatus since longtime lead vocalist Bennington committed suicide in
        July
        2017, and has not yet made plans to continue with a new vocalist, leaving the band's future uncertain.</p>
