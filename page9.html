      <p> During an Instagram live chat on December 17, 2017, Shinoda was asked whether Linkin Park would perform with a
        hologram version of Bennington in the future. He replied, "Can we not do a holographic Chester? I can't even
        wrap my head around the idea of a holographic Chester. I've actually heard other people outside the band suggest
        that, and there's absolutely no way. I cannot fuck with that.</p>
      <p>On January 28, 2018, Shinoda replied to a tweet from a fan inquiring about his future with Linkin Park, writing
        "I have every intention on continuing with LP, and the guys feel the same. We have a lot of rebuilding to do,
        and questions to answer, so it'll take time."[163] On March 29, 2018, however, Shinoda stated that he is
        uncertain of Linkin Park's future when being interviewed by Vulture.</p>
      <p>On April 17, 2018, Linkin Park was nominated for three awards at the 2018 Billboard Music Awards, but did not
        win any of them.</p>
      <p>The band was presented with The George and Ira Gershwin Award for Lifetime Musical Achievement at UCLA on May
        18, 2018</p>
      <p>On February 18, 2019, Shinoda said in an interview that the band is open to the idea of continuing though what
        form that takes has yet to be decided. Shinoda stated "I know the other guys, they love to be onstage, they love
        to be in a studio, and so to not do that would be like, I don’t know, almost like unhealthy.” When asked about
        the band's future minus Bennington, Shinoda stated, “It’s not my goal to look for a new singer. If it does
        happen, it has to happen naturally. If we find someone that is a great person and good stylistic fit, I could
        see trying to do some stuff with somebody. I would never want to feel like we are replacing Chester.”[167] As of
        October 2019, the band remains on an "indefinite hiatus".</p>
